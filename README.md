Do you have a threadpool?  Do you need someone to watch it?  Look no further!

#### Attributions

This gem is based on the thread pool implementation from [concurrent-ruby 0.5.0](https://github.com/jdantonio/concurrent-ruby/tree/v0.5.0)

After version 0.5.0 the author of concurrent-ruby decided to refactor the threadpool
implementation, this is an attempt improve the existing implementation rather
that to write something new from scratch.
